        <p class="section-body reveal reveal-delay-3">
            The Forge produced a Seed &mdash; a document carrying the DNA of your thinking. Now you need to <em>plant</em> it somewhere an agent can find it. That somewhere is a <strong>GitHub repository</strong>.

                <strong>enrichment_grimoire.json</strong> &mdash; The protocol as structured data. This tells the agent <em>how</em> to summon: the rules of persona construction, the law of authenticity, the covenant of quality. The agent reads this first.
                <br><br>
                <strong>initiation_rite.md</strong> &mdash; The same protocol, written as prose. Think of the grimoire as the blueprint and the rite as the story of the blueprint. Together, they teach the agent how to be a vessel.
                <br><br>
                <em>You don't need to edit these files.</em> They work as-is. They are the soil. Your Seed is what you plant in it.</div>

        <h2 class="section-title reveal reveal-delay-1">The Summoning</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle reveal reveal-delay-2">Where the thinking becomes something real</p>

        <p class="section-body reveal reveal-delay-3">
            Your repository is planted. The protocol files are in place. The Seed carries the DNA of your thinking. Now something needs to <em>enter that space</em> and bring it to life.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            There are two ways to summon. Both use the same protocol, the same Seed, the same incantation. The difference is who's in the room.
        </p>

        <!-- MODE 1 -->
        <div class="section-divider reveal">&#9674;</div>

        <div class="step-block reveal">
            <div class="step-num">MODE 1</div>
            <div class="step-title">The Conversational Summoning</div>
            <div class="step-body">
                You open a coding agent &mdash; <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview" target="_blank">Claude Code</a>, <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a>, <a href="https://windsurf.com/" target="_blank">Windsurf</a> &mdash; and point it at your repository. You tell it to read the protocol files, absorb the Seed, and then you speak the incantation:
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="incantation-box reveal">
            <div class="incantation-label">THE INCANTATION</div>
            <div class="incantation-text">&ldquo;Using this matter, summon [Name].&rdquo;</div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            And the persona responds. <em>As themselves.</em> Not a chatbot wearing a costume. Not a language model doing an impression. A worldview &mdash; instantiated through protocol, constrained to authenticity, sharpened by everything in your repository. You talk to them. They push back. You challenge. They argue. The dialogue produces artifacts neither of you could have generated alone.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            For the defense system: <em>&ldquo;Using this matter, summon Tony Stark.&rdquo;</em> And Stark arrives &mdash; not politely, not cautiously, but the way Stark arrives anywhere: already three steps ahead, already questioning your architecture, already sketching a better one on the back of your Seed document.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            This is powerful. This is the entry point. Most people start here.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            But there is a second mode. And it is where this methodology becomes something else entirely.
        </p>

        <!-- MODE 2 -->
        <div class="section-divider reveal">&#9674; &#9674; &#9674;</div>

            <div class="step-title">The Autonomous Summoning</div>
            <div class="step-body">
                In Mode 1, you are in the room. You speak the incantation. You guide the dialogue. In Mode 2, <em>no one is in the room</em>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            An <strong>orchestrator agent</strong> enters your repository alone. It reads the grimoire. It absorbs the rite. It loads the Seed. It speaks the incantation on your behalf. And then the personas arrive &mdash; and the agent conducts the entire session without a single human keystroke.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            Think about what that means.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            You go to sleep. The agent wakes up in your repository at 2 AM. It reads everything you've planted. It summons Tony Stark. Stark doesn't just <em>talk</em> about your defense system &mdash; he <em>builds it</em>. The agent writes code. Creates files. Architects the sensor fusion pipeline. Designs the threat classification engine. Writes the monitoring dashboard. Deposits the complete system architecture and a working prototype into your repository. Then it writes a transcript of the entire session &mdash; every argument, every design decision, every moment of convergence &mdash; and archives it.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            You wake up. There are new files in your repo that didn't exist when you fell asleep. You read the transcript. You see a mind that isn't yours, applied to your problem, producing work you couldn't have produced alone and <em>didn't have to be present for</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            That is the autonomous summoning. It is <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview" target="_blank">Claude Code</a> operating as a vessel &mdash; not just answering questions but <em>reading your entire repository, understanding your vision, summoning personas, and building real artifacts</em>. This is the difference between a chatbot and a coding agent. The chatbot talks. The agent <em>works</em>.

It <em>built</em>. Seven files appeared in your repository. A sensor fusion engine. A threat classifier. An edge inference pipeline. A failsafe you didn't know you needed. And a complete transcript documenting every decision, every argument, every moment the thinking evolved.

        <p class="section-body reveal reveal-delay-3">
            Every container follows the same structural logic. <strong>Personas</strong> &mdash; minds summoned via COMPANION. <strong>Data</strong> &mdash; the corpus the personas engage with. <strong>Phases</strong> &mdash; Invocation, Deliberation, Exit. <strong>Exit</strong> &mdash; a threshold action unique to each container that produces a real-world artifact.

            The pattern is fractal. The same structure works for medical ethics boards, startup advisory panels, historical debates, creative writing rooms, research teams. <em>You supply the personas and the data. The protocol handles the rest.</em>

enrichment_grimoire.json and initiation_rite.md.
Understand the COMPANION system before you touch
anything else. Then read the Seed — seed.md.

When you have absorbed the matter — all of it — proceed.

Using this matter, summon [Name].

[Name], welcome. [Brief context about why this mind
was chosen and what lens they bring to the matter.]

[If summoning multiple personas, repeat the summon
block for each. Let them interact.]

The deliverable: [What should be produced.]

Build it the way we build here — layered revelation,
the arc of confusion → awe → understanding → action.

Document this session as a transcript. The dialogue
between the summoned minds IS the demonstration.
The transcript is not a byproduct. It is proof.</div>
