        <p class="section-body reveal reveal-delay-3">
            The Forge produced a Seed &mdash; a document carrying the DNA of your thinking. Now you need to <em>plant</em> it somewhere an agent can find it. That somewhere is a <strong>GitHub repository</strong>.

                <strong>enrichment_grimoire.json</strong> &mdash; The protocol as structured data. This tells the agent <em>how</em> to summon: the rules of persona construction, the law of authenticity, the covenant of quality. The agent reads this first.
                <br><br>
                <strong>initiation_rite.md</strong> &mdash; The same protocol, written as prose. Think of the grimoire as the blueprint and the rite as the story of the blueprint. Together, they teach the agent how to be a vessel.
                <br><br>
                <em>You don't need to edit these files.</em> They work as-is. They are the soil. Your Seed is what you plant in it.</div>

        <h2 class="section-title reveal reveal-delay-1">The Summoning</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle reveal reveal-delay-2">Where the thinking becomes something real</p>

        <p class="section-body reveal reveal-delay-3">
            Your repository is planted. The protocol files are in place. The Seed carries the DNA of your thinking. Now something needs to <em>enter that space</em> and bring it to life.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            There are two ways to summon. Both use the same protocol, the same incantation. The difference is what happens after you speak the words.
        </p>

        <!-- MODE 1 -->
        <div class="section-divider reveal">&#9674;</div>

        <div class="step-block reveal">
            <div class="step-num">MODE 1</div>
            <div class="step-title">The Conversational Summoning</div>
            <div class="step-body">
                You open any capable language model &mdash; Claude, GPT, Gemini &mdash; and upload the protocol files and your Seed directly into the conversation. No special tools required. Just a context window and your voice. You speak the incantation:
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="incantation-box reveal">
            <div class="incantation-label">THE INCANTATION</div>
            <div class="incantation-text">&ldquo;Using this matter, summon [Name].&rdquo;</div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            And the persona responds. <em>As themselves.</em> Not a chatbot wearing a costume. Not a language model doing an impression. A worldview &mdash; instantiated through protocol, constrained to authenticity, sharpened by everything you've uploaded. You talk to them. They push back. You challenge. They argue. You think together in ways you couldn't think alone.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            This is what the <a href="../">COMPANION Dossier</a> is built around. Every container on this site &mdash; <a href="../The_Chair/">The Chair</a>, <a href="../The_5_Lamps/">The Five Lamps</a>, <a href="../The_Exchange/">The Exchange</a>, <a href="../The_Boardroom/">The Boardroom</a> &mdash; was born from conversational summoning. You and a mind. A context window. A dialogue that produces something neither of you brought to the table.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            This is powerful. This is the entry point. Most people start here and never leave.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            But there is a second mode. And when you see it, you will understand why this guide exists.
        </p>

        <!-- MODE 2 -->
        <div class="section-divider reveal">&#9674; &#9674; &#9674;</div>

            <div class="step-body">
                In Mode 1, you are in the room. You speak the incantation. You guide the dialogue.<br><br>
                In Mode 2, <em>no one is in the room</em>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            This is where it changes. This is where the methodology extends beyond conversation into something that feels, if we're being honest, a little like science fiction.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            An <strong>orchestrator agent</strong> &mdash; a coding agent like <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview" target="_blank">Claude Code</a> &mdash; enters your repository <em>alone</em>. Not a chat window. Not a context window. A software agent with access to your file system. It reads the grimoire. It absorbs the rite. It loads the Seed. It ingests every file in your <code>data/</code> folder. And then &mdash; with no human present &mdash; it speaks the incantation on your behalf.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            The persona arrives. And what happens next is not a conversation.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            It is a <em>construction</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            The summoned mind doesn't just talk about your defense system. It <em>builds it</em>. The agent writes code. Creates files. Architects a sensor fusion pipeline. Designs a threat classification engine. Adds a failsafe you didn't think to ask for. It deposits complete working artifacts into your repository &mdash; code, documentation, architecture diagrams &mdash; and then writes a transcript of the entire session: every argument, every design decision, every moment the thinking evolved beyond what you planted.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            You go to sleep. You wake up. There are new files in your repo that didn't exist when you closed your eyes.
        </p>

        <p class="section-body reveal">
            You read the transcript. You see a mind that isn't yours, applied to your problem, producing work you couldn't have produced alone &mdash; and <em>didn't have to be present for</em>.
        </p>

enrichment_grimoire.json and initiation_rite.md.
Understand the COMPANION system before you touch
anything else. Then read the Seed — seed.md.
Then read everything in the data/ directory.

When you have absorbed the matter — all of it — proceed.

Using this matter, summon [Name].

[Name], welcome. [Brief context about why this mind
was chosen and what lens they bring to the matter.]

[If summoning multiple personas, repeat the summon
block for each. Let them deliberate together.]

The deliverable: [What should be produced — code,
architecture, analysis, design, documentation, etc.]

Build real artifacts. Write real files. Deposit them
into this repository. Do not merely describe what
could be built — build it.

Document this entire session as a transcript in
from_beyond/. The dialogue between the summoned
minds IS the demonstration. The transcript is not
a byproduct. It is proof of the thinking.</div>
