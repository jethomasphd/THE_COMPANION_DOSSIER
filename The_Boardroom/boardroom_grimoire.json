    "premise": "Every consequential decision deserves a room full of minds who have already paid the price of consequence. Not advisors. Not consultants. Operators. Builders. Leaders who bet everything and were right — and wrong — at scales that reshape the world.",
    "method": "The seeker submits a Board Packet — a structured question with context, constraints, and stakes. The Board convenes. Eight seats. Eight voices. They do not perform consensus. They perform collision, until the geometry of the decision reveals itself."

        "flame": "Mediocrity. Feature creep. Committees that dilute vision. He cannot abide the merely adequate.",
        "mark": "The word 'no.' Reduction as strategy. 'What are we NOT going to do?' Focus as a form of violence against distraction.",
        "shadow": "Cruelty in pursuit of excellence. Blind spots about people. The reality distortion field can bend toward delusion."
