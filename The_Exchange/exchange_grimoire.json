  "inscription": "A labor exchange is a place where workers and employers find each other — not through scrolling, but through mutual encounter. THE EXCHANGE restores that mutuality through dialogue. A national job corpus and summoned personas converge in a container where the user arrives seeking work and leaves having been found by it. This grimoire governs the committee, the phases, and the threshold through which the seeker passes.",

  "lineage": {
    "tradition": "The COMPANION Protocol enables summoning minds across the boundary of time. THE EXCHANGE extends this into the boundary of livelihood — where the question is not 'what did the great dead think?' but 'what does the world of work hold for me, specifically, right now?' The committee here is not historical. It is archetypal. The data is not philosophy. It is a labor market corpus. The exit is not insight alone. It is action.",
