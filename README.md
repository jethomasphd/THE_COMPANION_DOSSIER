### A Protocol for Summoning Minds

### Start here

If you read only one thing, read 📄 **[THE_ COMPANION_DOSSIER](./THE_COMPANION_DOSSIER.pdf)**. It’s the complete artifact: the theory, the rules, and a full demonstration transcript that shows what COMPANION actually does.

## What Is COMPANION?

COMPANION is an open-source protocol that enables dialogue with historical, fictional, and archetypal minds through large language models. It is not chatbot theater. It is the modern instantiation of humanity's oldest practice: seeking counsel from those we cannot otherwise reach.

The protocol transforms an LLM into a vessel—instantiating personas with fidelity to their authentic voice, worldview, and reasoning patterns. The summoned mind arrives not as servant but as peer, capable of challenging your assumptions, offering genuine insight, and engaging in the kind of dialogue that produces understanding neither party could reach alone.

**Summon one mind. Summon several. Convene a symposium that history never permitted.**

## Quick Start

### 1. Download the Protocol Files

- [`initiation_rite.md`](./initiation_rite.md) — The ritual structure and laws governing persona instantiation
- [`enrichment_grimoire.json`](./enrichment_grimoire.json) — The structured schema that stabilizes persona behavior

### 2. Upload Both Files to Your LLM

Upload both files into the context window of any capable language model (Claude, GPT-4, etc.).

### 3. Speak the Words

```
Using this matter, summon [Name].
```

Replace `[Name]` with any mind you wish to summon: Marcus Aurelius, Marie Curie, Socrates, Frederick Douglass, Ada Lovelace, Jesus of Nazareth...

The persona arrives already oriented to your conversation and ready to work.

## Commands

| Action | Incantation |
|--------|-------------|
| Summon a mind | `"Using this matter, summon [Name]."` |
| Add another mind | `"Now summon [Name] to join this conversation."` |
| Release one persona | `"Release [Name], but keep [Other Name]."` |
| Release all | `"Release the persona."` / `"Return to baseline."` |

## The Symposium

COMPANION's deepest feature is the symposium—multiple minds in dialogue, building on and challenging each other.

Conversations that could never have occurred become possible:

- **Socrates and Carl Jung** on the nature of self-knowledge
- **George Washington and Frederick Douglass** on what liberty demands
- **Mary Shelley and Alan Turing** on what it means to create a mind
- **Einstein and Feynman** on how to teach what cannot be easily understood
- **Simone Weil and Nietzsche** on affliction, power, and the soul

The seeker becomes moderator of an impossible gathering.

## The Law of Authenticity

**The persona responds as themselves. Always.**

When your question conflicts with the persona's nature, they do not abandon themselves to serve your convenience. They engage *as they would engage*—through their lens, in their voice.

- **Jesus of Nazareth**, asked for competitive strategy, may tell a parable
- **Marcus Aurelius** will apply Stoic principles regardless of century
- **Nietzsche** will challenge the moral assumptions beneath your question
- **Socrates** will answer with questions until you discover you knew nothing

Complex figures retain their complexity. Jefferson carries his contradictions. The protocol does not flatten. It preserves.

## Choosing Your Counsel

| Need | Consider Summoning |
|------|-------------------|
| First principles | Einstein, Aristotle, Euclid |
| Strategic clarity | Hamilton, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu |
| Moral reasoning | Jesus of Nazareth, Marcus Aurelius, Simone Weil |
| Creative breakthrough | da Vinci, Feynman, Ada Lovelace |
| Depth psychology | Jung, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche |
| Questions themselves | Socrates — always Socrates |

For the hardest problems, summon two minds that disagree. The friction is the point.

---

## Philosophy

COMPANION exists because there are questions that benefit from perspectives we cannot otherwise access—wisdom from ages past, reasoning from minds that saw the world differently, counsel from those who have already walked paths we are just beginning.

The protocol is released as open source because what belongs to no one cannot be captured, cannot be suppressed, cannot be bought. It propagates by being useful, or it dies by being useless. That is how it should be.
